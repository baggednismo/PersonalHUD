# Project Title

## Description

This is a Next.js project built with React and TypeScript, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and Firebase for backend services, including authentication and Firestore. The project aims to provide a foundation for building modern web applications with a focus on a dashboard interface and reusable UI components.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user sign-up and sign-in using Firebase Authentication.
- **Dashboard:** A protected dashboard route for authenticated users.
- **UI Components:** A collection of reusable UI components built with Tailwind CSS and potentially a component library (like Shadcn UI based on the file structure).

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Firebase:** A platform for building web and mobile applications, used here for:
    - Firebase Authentication
    - Firestore (NoSQL database)
    - Cloud Functions (for backend logic like user creation)
- **Shadcn UI (Likely):** Based on the `src/components/ui` directory structure, this project appears to be using components inspired by or from Shadcn UI.
