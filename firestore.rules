      // 1. `request.auth != null`: Ensures the user is authenticated.
      // 2. `request.auth.uid == userId`: Ensures the authenticated user's ID matches the
      //    {userId} segment in the document path they are trying to access.
      //    The {document=**} wildcard matches all documents and subcollections under the user's path.

    // Rule 2: Default Deny for Other Top-Level Collections (Security Best Practice)
    // Explicitly denies access to any other top-level collections that are not /users.
    // This prevents accidental exposure or modification of data in unintended collections.
